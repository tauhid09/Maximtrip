                                            Planning a trip to Kashmir, especially for couples, requires thoughtful
                                            preparation to ensure a smooth and memorable trip. Here are some essential

                                            1. Choose the Right time
                                            Kashmir experiences different charms throughout the year. Summer (April to
                                            June) offers pleasant weather ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities.
                                            Winter (November to February) transforms Kashmir into a snowy wonderland,
                                            perfect for skiing and enjoying cozy moments by the fireplace. Spring (March

                                            stunning landscapes, making them great times for exploring. Depending on

                                            plan to explore different regions like Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam.
                                            Don’t forget essentials like sunscreen, sunglasses, and comfortable footwear
